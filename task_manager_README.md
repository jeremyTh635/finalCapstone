# task_manager.py ReadMe

### What it is and what it does

This was the main capstone project for the Hyperion.dev software engineering bootcamp which I participated in from March to July, 2023.

The purpose of the program is to assign various tasks to staff in an office and track their progress. Part of the brief for participants in the course was to refactor the code to include several different functions to achieve the main goals of the program.

The program depends, initially, on two text files, one listing the usernames and passwords of the staff, the other listing the tasks with information such as the person assigned to it and the due date for completion.

The functions in the program have the following purposes:
1.	To register new users.
2.	To add tasks with appropriate details.
3.	To view all the listed tasks.
4.	To view the tasks assigned to individual users. Users are able to mark their tasks as complete as well as change the user assigned to the task or the completion date.
5.	To create two new text files to display figures for each user about their tasks including the percentage completed and the percentage overdue.

Select ‘Save link as… and save the file to whichever location you want on your computer. Now you can run the program.

It is recommended that you also download the text files **user.txt** and **tasks.txt** and install them in the same directory as the main program.

### How to use the project

When you run the program, you will be asked to log on. You will need to have installed the text files mentioned above to do this. The default login username and password are ‘admin’ and ‘password’. You will then be presented with a menu displaying the options at your disposal. It is recommended to begin by creating new users and adding new tasks to appreciate the full functionality of the program. When you have finished, the menu includes the option to exit the program.
