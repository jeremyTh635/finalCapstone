# finance_calculators.py ReadMe

### What it is and what it does

This is the first capstone project I did. The project was intended to give practice in using control structures, especially conditional statements. The program does two things depending on the user’s choice. One of them is to calculate the return on an investment; the other is to calculate the cost of a mortgage. Basically, in either case, the program takes three inputs from the user, the amount of money, the interest rate and the period of time involved and calculates how much the user will either gain or have to pay out. The program is useful for anyone considering investing or buying a house especially when interest rates are volatile.

### How to use the project

When the program begins to run the user is presented with a choice of calculating how much interest they will earn on an investment or how much they will have to pay for a home loan. If they choose the investment route, they are offered a further choice of whether they want to receive simple or compound interest. They are also asked how many years they want to continue the investment. The program will output the total amount at the end of the period and the user’s profit margin. If the user chooses the mortgage, the are asked to input the current price of the house, the interest rate and the repayment period. The program will calculate the total cost and display it in the console.
