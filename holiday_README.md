# holiday.py README

### What it is and what it does

This is a basic program that makes use of dictionaries and functions to calculate the cost of a holiday. The user is presented with four destinations and asked to choose one of them. The destinations are the keys in the dictionaries. The values are:
1.	The price of a return air ticket
2.	The price of a single night in a hotel
3.	The cost of renting a car for a day
In addition to selecting their destination, the user is also asked to input the number of nights they want to stay in a hotel and the number of days they want to rent a car. The program is then able to calculate the total cost of the holiday and output it to the user.

The approach taken here, though simple, could form the basis of something larger-scale and more complex.

### How to use the project
Using this program is very easy. First the user is asked where they want to go for their holiday and is presented with a list of available destinations to choose from. They are then asked to input the number of nights they want to stay at a hotel and number of days they want to rent a car. The program will tell them the total cost with a breakdown of the individual costs for flight, hotel and car.
