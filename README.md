# finalCapstone
## A selection of projects that I completed on my recent bootcamp with Hyperion.dev

At present, this repository contains the following files:
1.	**task_manager.py**
2.	**calculator.py**
3.	**holiday.py**
4.	**finance_calculators.py**

Each file has its own accompanying README file.

There are also two text files, **user.txt** and **tasks.txt** which are required for **task_manager.py** to function.
