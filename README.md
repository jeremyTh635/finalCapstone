## This repository features several Python projects I completed during my recent bootcamp with Hyperion.dev.

At present, it contains the following files:
1.	**task_manager.py**
2.	**calculator.py**
3.	**holiday.py**
4.	**finance_calculators.py**

Each file has its own accompanying README file.

There are also two text files, **user.txt** and **tasks.txt** which are required for **task_manager.py** to function.
